Hello everybody and welcome to another publishing video here on the channel, where we're going to be getting into the financial breakdowns for my first two self-published books, Breach of Peace and Rebel's Creed. I do want to start this off by apologizing for not getting this video to you a little bit sooner. I was originally planning on getting this out in 2022, but due to a mixture of anxiety and just being incredibly busy, this video kind of just kept getting delayed and delayed to the point where it just kind of faded into the constant tension I feel as someone who suffers from severe anxiety. And I just forgot about it until I came across a Reddit post on the subreddit here for the channel, where someone was asking when if it was going to get done, and someone even responded maybe speculating that possibly my books just did so poorly that I didn't want to showcase. It's kind of actually the opposite of that. When I started the journey to try and put out these books, I thought in my just naive estimate, I would sell roughly as many copies as I had patrons. It made sense to me that, okay, if 1500-ish people, which was about how many patrons I had in the time, like the channel enough to support me by going the extra mile there, I'll probably sell maybe a few hundred more copies than that. That was really stupid to think. And then the organic growth for the book also exceeded my expectations at getting several reviews here on YouTube from people who had mixed responses, which I have appreciated the critical feedback and the positive. It's been great, and I've taken a lot of that to learn to do better for my next book, Neon Ghosts, publication date coming soon. And then it even started to take off in places like Bookstagram and TikTok. I even got a couple websites reviewing the book. Books. And as the dollar amounts kept rising and rising, I was really afraid if I made this video, it was gonna come across like I was just bragging about how good my books did. I don't ever want to be one of those YouTubers who is, like, flexing his cash on people. I find that to be tacky and disgusting. But I also am a very big believer in financial transparency in pretty much every industry in existence. It allows people at all levels to better understand their own value. And, in addition to that, the insights you get from looking at how much money I made where from my books also helps highlight just how bad the Amazon Titan grip on the self-publishing industry really is. And so for those reasons, I decided to finally get this done. But if my tone seems a bit different, it's because I am still very, very nervous doing this. But if I'm going to do something that could be taken as kind of douchey, let's go ahead and look the part. Black t-shirt, check. The chain, check. Unnecessarily large secondary ring, check. And now, I need unnecessary YouTube flair to grab your attention and make you think that I'm quirky and special. I haven't put contacts in since I got my LASIK, so let's see how this goes. Wash my hands first. Do I seem quirky yet relatable? But in all seriousness, though, I do also need to say before we get into the units and then the actual cash, thank you everyone who has supported my authorial career. It is actually a dream come true for me. I grew up reading Tolkien, Pullman, Jordan, Le Guin, and now having a book that has sold well enough to be ranked on Amazon even at all was enough to make me cry when it happened. I am going to be hustling to constantly be improving. I'm incredibly proud of my first two books, but I already know how much better I can do, and I can't wait to prove that to you in my next book. You all are why I'm able to do this, and I genuinely feel so much love. Tangentially coming off of that, if you are someone who wants to self-publish a book, please, obviously, I don't know why I feel the need to clarify this, but just in case someone out there doesn't get it, do not compare your initial sales numbers to mine. I am coming from a place of extraordinary privilege within the self-publishing space, having this platform to promote myself on, and no one should feel bad for not matching my numbers. The exact opposite. That is normal. That is fine. I have an advantage that is just straight-up unfair over other indie authors. That's why I like to help promote them here on the channel whenever I get the chance. I can't read ****. Oh my God. But before we jump into the units and money, a quick word from today's sponsor, because this video is brought to you by... Campfire! In my personal opinion, if you are looking to write a fantastical or sci-fi world, there is no better writing tool to look into than Campfire. Chock full of incredible features, tailor-made to help you as an author be able to organize your thoughts and get them down on the page, Campfire's value is immense, and you get to decide it yourself with a choose-your-own-pricing model that has made Campfire accessible to just about everybody. You can also just pay for the certain modules you would like to use, like if you want to have their awesome map layout with all the little hidden compartments in there just to keep in mind where your characters are and why, you could buy just that. And even better, their current mobile app, which has all of these features, is free, with no ads. How are they able to do that? I don't... know. I also have been given a little bit of a sneak peek behind the scenes, and Campfire has some very exciting stuff in the works. There is no better time than right now to jump into their community, learn how to use this tool, and get running with crafting your fantastical works. So if you'd like to check out Campfire today, which I do genuinely believe is the best writing aid on the market, you can even just straight up write your book in it now. Check out the link in the description down below, and choose your own price. But getting into the units sold. So I actually sold the paperback versions of my book through a company called IngramSpark. I do not like them, I think they are very rough when it comes to not only your ability to put your book together on their site as an author, but their lack of tools available behind the scenes, which is a video for a whole other day, is severely disappointing. And even their latest upgrade for their new reports I find to be substantially worse than their old reports, which were already bad. But! Video for another day, I'm sorry. When it comes to exactly how many books I sold physical copies of between 2021 and 2022, the total comes to, I really can't read right now, 29,742 books. So yeah, my initial estimate of total across all mediums of it being available of only selling a couple thousand, was blown out of the f***ing water. Thank you, again, so much. Now when it comes to ebooks, I want you to specifically listen to these numbers. Unfortunately, I can't give you every specific vendor due to a technical issue happening on my side right now, but I can give you the two biggest for me personally, which would be of course, Kindle and Google. When it comes to my total ebooks sold through KDP, or Kindle Direct Publishing, which I have never been exclusive with as long as I've been on Kindle, I've been on Google Books, I sold 10,599 copies. Now when comparing that to the largest competitor in terms of how many I sold, on Google, I only sold 685 copies. I think this might put in context why for other indie authors who do not have a platform to promote themselves on like me, it becomes understandable why they end up signing up for Kindle exclusive and things along those lines, because the larger percentages you get there for being exclusive, absolutely smash the potential profit you could make by making your book even just available on any other competitors. This is why it's a problem. And then for Audible, which I was exclusive on for both periods we're looking at, 2021 and 2022, I no longer am. My books are actually up for free here on my YouTube channel. Go ahead and check them out if you'd like to. I sold 11,169 copies, which I think is skewed a little bit higher than some people who self-publish typically get in terms of percentages between the mediums, and that is likely due to the fact that I spent extra money up front to get two of my favorite narrators of all time, Michael Kramer and Kate Redding, which I'll use as an excuse to talk about the fact that yes, hiring audiobook narrators, art, cover design, editors, total for the first two books came to a total of roughly $10,000 for me. I wasn't able to find every single invoice, but I think that was the budget I had. Importantly of note, my next book, Neon Ghosts, will exclusively be on Audible and Kindle, which absolutely sucks and is part of the reason why I pulled my first two books from being exclusively there. It is due to the fact that my next book is not being self-published, it is being trad published, and before this issue was brought to light, I had already signed the contract. I have tried to change it, I have asked people, but I would essentially be screwing over small companies who, again, must have that larger split and higher percentage from Amazon for their business model to make sense, and I feel bad trying to twist their arm getting to change it, if it were up to me, yes I would, but I cannot ask people trying to run small businesses to do something that would financially impact them on that level. I really hope you understand, and just know that there will be a physical copy also available that will not benefit anybody except for those smaller businesses and myself. But that brings us to the money. For the total in print sales, that 29,742 books resulted in a total payday of $122,964. Far more money than I ever imagined I would make for my publishing career, let alone just from my first two books in the first two years. Once you add in the Kindle Direct Publishing, which came to a total of $31,599, the Google Publishing, which came to $2,230, and the audiobook, which came to a total of $21,790, I received a payment of $178,583.77. Now, my ebook was available on a few other vendors aside from Kindle and Google, which again, I'm unable to get the analytics there right now due to a technical difficulty, because they're through one vent. Anyway, I just added in an additional two grand, because it was not much I have ever received from any of those platforms, and I think I'm actually being a little bit generous for myself there, might be a few hundred under that, but that brings the total to $180,583.77. Most of that money went for a very generous down payment on my house, I've always wanted to live in a townhome, and that is where a bulk of it went. I genuinely couldn't keep the rings on that much longer, I thought I might be a ring guy for a while, but I just don't think it's for me. So at the end of the day, I am over the moon with how my books have done as a whole, and the gratitude I feel towards my audience, and the feedback I have gotten, both critical and praising, has been invaluable to me. Pulling my first two books from being exclusively from Audible means I shouldn't expect to see that Audible number rise much more, but I would just personally prefer you go to my YouTube channel, where they're up for free with simply, I think, very minimal ad breaks, and enjoy Michael Kramer and Kate Redding's performances, that I... oh, I'm so happy to have for my books. The worst part was its skin. At first, Clid thought the thing was wearing a baggy robe. As her eyes focused, it became clear those folds were flesh. A line of spit dribbled from those exposed teeth, and as the demon realized it had been spotted, it emitted a guttural hiss. Unfortunately, they just weren't the right fit for my next book, so it's going to be a different narrator, but I am equally thrilled with them. But let me know what you think of me doing this, the results, the insights you're able to pull from, especially in the industry level, in the comments down below. Of course, if you're interested in picking up my books, I always have links down there as well. And thank you, Campfire, for sponsoring today's video. Really, I cannot recommend that software enough if you're someone like me, who has just a scatterbrain approach to writing a book, or if you like incessantly taking notes. They kind of are adjusted to help both groups. Like and subscribe if you have not already. Hit the Patreon if you like to support what I do here. And have a good one, y'all.
